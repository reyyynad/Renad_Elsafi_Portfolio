# Personal Portfolio (Renad Elsafi Portfolio) – Assignment 1

## About This Project
This is my first step into building a professional portfolio. It’s a simple, responsive web application that shows who I am, what projects I’ve worked on, and how to contact me.  

The site has four main sections:  
- **About Me** – A short introduction, a tagline, and a profile picture.  
- **Projects** – Two projects with a title, short description, and placeholder image.  
- **Experience (Extra)** – One experience with a title, short description, and an icon.  
- **Contact** – A basic form to send your name, email, and message (no backend needed).  

The goal of this project was to practice **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, make the site responsive across devices, and use AI tools to help improve the code and styling. Also, I have used figma to create the design of my portfolio.

## How AI Helped

I used AI to make development smoother and faster:

* **ChatGPT** – Helped me debug the JavaScript and fix interactive elements.
* **Claude** – Gave a huge help on CSS styling, layout improvements, and adding animations to make the portfolio look more lively and match the figma design i made.

For a more detailed explanation of how AI was used, see [docs/ai-usage-report.md](docs/ai-usage-report.md).
